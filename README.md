## 📊 Sales Forecasting Project

This project forecasts future sales using machine learning and deep learning models on historical sales data.  

### 🔍 Key Features
- Time-series preprocessing and feature engineering.  
- Models: ARIMA, LSTM, and regression-based approaches.  
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual sales trends.  
- Evaluation with RMSE, MAE, and accuracy metrics.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Statsmodels)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for trend visualization  

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the notebook to generate forecasts
